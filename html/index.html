        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-1xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Hi, I am Dipen. I am interested in science & technology. I am majoring in Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Delhi. I am a third year undergraduate. I was brought up in Nepal and was 10-year-old when I moved to Patna for education. I was in high school junior year when science & research life fascinated me. I joined college to pursue my interest as career where I was introduced to engineering & technology particularly Computer Science. I enjoy music, running, watching documentaries and writing.</p>
        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-1xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">MY MOTIVATION</h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I am a young computer enthusiast who seeks to explore Computer Science with a research mindset in a formal way. I am always looking to get research experience that will sharpen my vision for a research career. It will also help me better decide on my Ph.D. plans. I want to take every opportunity as an undergraduate student to explore the diverse field of computer science as broad and as deep as I can. Hence I am willing to learn the science behind other areas in Computer Science new to me.</p>
        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-1xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">MY INTERESTS</h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Among all the completed courses, I liked Programming Languages and Computer Architecture the most. Last semester I did a few amazing courses. I explored the field of Computer Networks, AI, and ML. I think making while learning is a good practice and a fun learning mode. I have created small projects like an app that provides an interface to a well-organized repository of my notes to my friends, a blogging network to help them connect internally in the IITD community. I enjoy programming, and sometimes I participate in competitive programming.</p>
        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-1xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">EXPERIENCE & SKILL SET</h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">My experience mainly includes niche work in some fundamental areas of computer science like Computer Networks, Machine Learning, Computer Architecture, Programming Languages, Data Structures and Algorithms. I have some experience in Web Development and Android Development. I have proficiency in C/C++, Java, Python, and Ocaml. I have both experiences of working independently and collaborating in a Team. I have experience working with tight deadlines.</p>
